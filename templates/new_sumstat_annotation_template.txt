#Comments can be entered like this.

#This is a template for annotating new GWAS sumstats. The annotation file should have the same name as the sumstats file but with the suffix .txt.
#The file consists of a list of key-value pairs (rows). The key and the value should be separated by whitespace such as tabs. The key can't contain whitespace. This format will make it easy for a program to read the information later.

#The keys are presented in a rough order of priority. Please provide as much information about the GWAS sumstat as possible. Remove unused rows and text.
